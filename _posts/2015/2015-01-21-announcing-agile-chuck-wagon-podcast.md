I'm pleased to announce the Agile Chuck Wagon podcast! Each episode will be a short talk about an agile or lean software delivery topic, including techniques like design patterns that help teams stay agile. Please join me!

Topics ready for release include an introduction to the principles of Kanban, the decorator pattern, and offshore teams.

Here's a link to the first episode: (_Editor's note: defunct_)

If you have comments or suggestions for topics, please leave a comment on the Durfweb post (_Editor's note: no longer available_). Future announcements about the podcast will appear there.
