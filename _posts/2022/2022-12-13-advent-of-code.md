I participated in the first several days of [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I enjoyed the first few tests, but I found the story around the more recent tests to stretch believability. When personal circumstances impacted my time to hobby program, it led me to stop.

If you're interested in the solutions I wrote, I uploaded my work to [my Code Kata GitHub repo](https://github.com/neontapir/code-katas/tree/main/advent_of_code_2022).
