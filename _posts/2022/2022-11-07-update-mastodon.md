It's been a while since I've posted here.

The change that prompted me to update my blog was a renewed interest in Mastodon. I set up an account in 2018, but there wasn't enough content at the time to keep me engaged. However, with the recent changes at Twitter, I've joined a multitude of people who are revising their Mastodon accounts. The link to mine is in the sidebar.

By the way, I used [these instructions](https://www.janwagemakers.be/jekyll/jekyll/2019/08/22/mastodon-share-button.html) to add a share to Mastodon button to my Jeckyl-generated blog. Thanks, Jan!
