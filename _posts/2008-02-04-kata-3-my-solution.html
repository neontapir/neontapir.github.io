<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131016085513/http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_three_how_.html">Kata 3</a> has to do with estimation. The full questions are on Dave's blog.</p>
<p>How Big?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Roughly how many binary digits (bit) are required for the unsigned representation of: </em>
<ul>
<li>1,000 : <strong>10</strong> </li>
<li>1,000,000 : <strong>14</strong> </li>
<li>1,000,000,000 : <strong>18</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li>1,000,000,000,000 : <strong>22</strong>&nbsp; </li>
<li>8,000,000,000,000 : <strong>25</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>My town has approximately 20,000 residences....</em>&nbsp;<strong><em>Let's allow 100 characters for a name, 150 for an address, and 15 characters for a phone number. 165 * 20000 = 310000 characters</em></strong>&nbsp; </li>
<li><em>I’m storing 1,000,000 integers in a binary tree....</em> <strong>I don't know much about binary trees, but I would expect it to have ln 1,000,000 levels. Based on my answer above, that'd be about 14, yielding 2^14 nodes. As for space, each number could be stored in 14 bytes, which would be 14 MB for a million numbers.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How Fast?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>My copy of Meyer’s Object Oriented Software Construction...</em>&nbsp;<strong>I'm going to guess about 120,000 words. Let's say the average word in a technical text is 5 characters long, so that's 600,000 letters. With formatting, I'd budget 900kb for plain text. This jives with my recollections of Project Gutenburg novels.</strong> </li>
<li><em>My binary search algorithm...</em> <strong>It should go exponentially, so a hundredfold increase in entries caused a 1.5ms increase. The next one is another hundredfold, so that would be 1.5ms x 1.5 ms, or 2.25mS. So, I say 7.75ms.</strong> </li>
<li><em>Unix passwords are stored using a one-way hash function...</em> <strong>Well, that would be 96! / (96 - 16)!, which is 96 * 95 * ... * 80, or about 88^16, or about 7700^8, or about 670000^4, or about 44x10^8 ^2, or about 176x10^16 ms. There's 1.5x10^9 seconds per year, so it would take millions of years to crack the algorithm. My answer is no. :)</strong></li>
</ul>
