<p>Chuck talks about a concept from the new book <a href="https://www.mbs.works/theadvicetrap"><em>The Advice Trap</em></a> by Michael Bungay Stanier, the Advice Monster. This tendency to inject ourselves into coaching comes with three personas: Tell-It, Save-It, and Control-It. Chuck uses personal examples for each.</p>
