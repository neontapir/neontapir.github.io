<p>Chuck talks about metrics and why it's important not to fixate on a particular target. Although the episode doesn't call the out by name, this is an expression of a couple of well-known principles. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect" target="_blank">Hawthorn Effect</a> says<em> </em>that which is measured will improve, at a cost. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" target="_blank">Goodhart’s Law</a> says that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</p>
