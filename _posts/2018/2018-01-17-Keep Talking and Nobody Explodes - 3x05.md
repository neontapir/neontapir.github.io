<p>In this episode of the Agile Chuck Wagon, Chuck talks about a game called Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. It is a collaborative game, using a computer program and PDF printout to simulate the activity of defusing a bomb through solving logic puzzles. Thus, it makes for a fun virtual teambuilding exercise. <br /><br />You can find out more about this game at its homepage, <a href="http://www.keeptalkinggame.com">www.keeptalkinggame.com</a>.<br /><br />This episode is sponsored by our friends and generous backers on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/agilechuckwagon">Patreon</a>.
