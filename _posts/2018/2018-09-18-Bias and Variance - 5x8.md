<p>Today, Chuck talks about the statistics concepts of bias and variance, which are used to measure predictive models. Bias measures how well the model fits the data, and variance measures how much the model changes when inputs change. He then uses bias and variance to make a comparison of agile methodologies, whose estimation and planning practices can be viewed as predictive models.</p>
