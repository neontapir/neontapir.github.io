## Agile Chuck Wagon, season 4, episode 7

Chuck talks about ways to respond to inappropriate behavior, a topic that unfortunately concerns many leaders in agile spaces like scrum masters. The material for this episode is drawn from the book, "Encouraging Appropriate Behaviour" by Murray Irwin. (length: 10 min)
