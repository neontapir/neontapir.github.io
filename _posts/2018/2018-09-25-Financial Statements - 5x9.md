<p>In today's episode, Chuck talks about an accounting topic, financial statements. He introduces the idea of a statement of cash flows, balance sheet, and income statement. He talks about assets, liabilities, equity, and other accounting terms. After hearing this episode, maybe the quarterly earnings report will be a little more interesting.Â </p>
