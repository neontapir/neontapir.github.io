## Agile Chuck Wagon, season 5, episode 7

This episode features the 4 D's of receiving feedback: defensiveness, denial, discounting, drama. Chuck uses an example of an employee who shows up late for a meeting to talk about what each of these might sound like. The inspiration for this episode is a TEDx talk by Alison Whitmore.
