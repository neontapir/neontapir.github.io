### Agile Chuck Wagon, season 5, episode 8

Today, Chuck talks about the statistics concepts of bias and variance, which are used to measure predictive models.

He then uses bias and variance to make a comparison of agile methodologies, whose estimation and planning practices can be viewed as predictive models. (length: 7 min)
