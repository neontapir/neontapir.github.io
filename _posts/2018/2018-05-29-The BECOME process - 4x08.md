<p>As a follow-up to a prior episode, Chuck talks about BECOME, a step-by-step approach to respond to an incident of inappropriate behavior as a teachable moment when possible. The name is an acronym for the six steps in the process: Behavior, Emergency, Context, Options, Myself and Enact. The material for this episode is drawn from the book, "Encouraging Appropriate Behaviour" by Murray Irwin.</p>
