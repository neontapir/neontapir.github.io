Recently, I discovered Gists, a code snippet publishing platform by GitHub. In fact, a Gist is essentially a one-file GitHub repository.

I published [two Gists](https://gist.github.com/neontapir) recently. The first is a C# code sample of an ASP.NET Web API service that uses `AttributeRouting`. I found some examples of each piece, but not in combination. It took some time to get it working, so I thought it was worth sharing.

The other is a build script for the [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) editor, which renders an [AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) document in HTML on a Windows system. It was inspired by [this user's gist](https://gist.github.com/karmi/3804588) for a Unix system.

If you are looking for a quick way to share a code snippet, Gists are a good choice. Likewise, if you are looking for something similar to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) that's more fully featured, Asciidoc may be the thing for you. Not only can you generate HTML, but it can be used to produce LateX, PDF and DocBook documents amongst others.
