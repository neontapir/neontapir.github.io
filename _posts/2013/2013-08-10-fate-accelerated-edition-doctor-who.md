Inspired by a gentleman named Ulric on Google+ who is writing a _Doctor Who_ setting for Fate Core, I thought I'd have a go at it using Fate Accelerated Edition. I ended up writing more than a post's worth of stuff, so I'm providing a link to the document in HTML format (_Editor's note: defunct_). Let me know what you think.

So far, I have a write-up for the Regeneration stunt and three incarnations of the Doctor as character samples. I also have the TARDIS as an Extra. Since then, I've been looking through the Fate System Toolkit and was excited to see a couple of nods to _Doctor Who_. I am close to ready to play-test an adventure using this adaptation.
