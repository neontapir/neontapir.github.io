<p>Inspired by a gentleman named Ulric on Google+ who is writing a <em>Doctor Who</em> setting for Fate Core, I thought I'd have a go at it using Fate Accelerated Edition. I ended up writing more than a post's worth of stuff, so I'm providing a link to the <strong><a href="http://neontapir.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fae-drwho.html">document in HTML format</a></strong>. Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>So far, I have a write-up for the Regeneration stunt and three incarnations of the Doctor as character samples. I also have the TARDIS as an Extra. Since then, I've been looking through the Fate System Toolkit and was excited to see a couple of nods to <em>Doctor Who</em>. I am close to ready to playtest an adventure using this adaptation.</p>
