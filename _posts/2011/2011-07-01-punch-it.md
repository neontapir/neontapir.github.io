Having met with the president elect of the company and several higher-ups, I’m
nervous that I signed myself up for one of those “maximum warp till the engines
can’t take it any more” projects.

I’m hoping that when the team gels and starts delivering, more resources may be
in the cards. Looking toward the endgame, there could be more lines of code to
write than our timeframe will permit.

However, I have a 3-day weekend ahead, so I plan to punch it towards the Shore
Leave planet.
