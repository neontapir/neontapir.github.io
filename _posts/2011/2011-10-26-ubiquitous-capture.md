The idea behind ubiquitous capture is that you can dump things on your mind into a storage medium (notebook, what have you) so that you don’t have to tie up attention re-remembering things to keep them fresh in your mind. I have David Allen and Merlin Mann to thank for convincing me this is a good idea.

Today, after listening to Brett Terpstra on Mac Power Users, I’m trying a new (to me) ubiquitous capture workflow. It’s slightly different than what’s discussed on the show.

The _lingua franca_ is [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). The more I use it, the more I like it.

### Software

*   _nvALT_ 2.1, Brett Terpstra’s fork of Notational Velocity
*   _Byword_ 1.4, a minimalist and sexy Markdown-friendly text editor ($9.99)
*   _Dropbox_
*   _Nocs_ for iPhone, a Markdown-friendly editor with Dropbox support

### Setup

*   Change the note storage location for nvALT to a Dropbox folder
*   Add .md as a text extension in nvALT (see [this Skitch](https://skitch.com/jesmithiv/fpk26/md-ext))
*   Tell nvALT to store and read notes on disk as Plain Text Files

Let me know what you think.
