<p>Welcome to those of you who saw me present at Mile High Agile 2013 on Design Patterns in Non-Software Contexts. I made a mad dash back to the room and got the flipcharts before they were disposed of by the hotel. Over the next few days, I plan to post the slide deck and type up the examples we as a group came up with.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the volunteers who make that conference possible. I did registration again this year, but that's just a small part of the work that needs to happen to make a conference of that size work. Thanks also to the attendees and other speakers, who were very encouraging.</p>
