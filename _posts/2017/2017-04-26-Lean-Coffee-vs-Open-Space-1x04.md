## Agile Chuck Wagon, season 1, episode 4

Fresh off the episode about [Dot Voting (1x03)](http://agilechuckwagon.com/dot-voting-1x03), Chuck compares two popular meeting facilitation techniques in agile: lean coffee and open space. Lean Coffee is well suited for a small group of participants, who use a Kanban backlog and dot voting to work through a list of discussion topics. Open space has similar goals, but uses a marketplace of ideas and runs multiple conversations in parallel. Open space is a better fit for large groups. (length: 16 min)
