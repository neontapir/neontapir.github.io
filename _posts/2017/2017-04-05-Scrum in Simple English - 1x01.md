<p>In this inaugural episode (1x01), Chuck gives an overview of Scrum in 5 minutes using Simple English.The idea for this episode came from a statement by Lyssa Adkins of <a href="http://www.coachingagileteams.com/"><em>Coaching Agile Teams</em></a> fame. He talks about Charles Ogden and Basic English (<a href="/agilechuckwagon/episode/update/id/ogden.basic-english.org">ogden.basic-english.org</a>), and how it grew into Simple English. After giving a description of Scrum, Chuck talks about why this exercise is worthwhile.</p>
