I enjoy tabletop roleplaying (RPG), but there are times where I can't meet up with friends to play. That's why I became excited when I found Ironsworn, a fantasy game which offers a solo play mode.

<!--more-->

For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, let me elaborate. Roleplaying is a hobby with a broad range of expression. The most well-known game, Dungeons and Dragons, takes a tactical simulation approach. Other games like Apocaplyse World (AW) emphasize storytelling. Apocalypse World has enjoyed popularity in the roleplaying community, and has spawned many games that using its system. Some games like Dungeon World stay close to the original AW system and are said to be "Powered by the Apocalyse", but other derivatives like Ironsworn make significant changes.

One element that Ironsworn kept from AW is the idea of 'moves'. In AW games, players describe their character's actions. Until they trigger a move, it's like collaborative storytelling. Moves describe a piece of the rules that apply in a given situation (the "trigger"), and provide guidance for deciding what happens based on a role of the dice. In many AW games, there is a Master of Ceremonies (MC) who decides if moves apply and interprets the player's die rolls. However, in Ironsworn, there are solo and co-op modes in which the players take on the duties of MC themselves. As you might expect, in co-op mode there are multiple players, and in solo mode, there's only one player. In this play report, that solo player is me.

Play reports are useful to roleplayers, so they can see an RPG system in action. I posted some play reports on the Ironsworn Google Plus group, and thought I'd republish the first few here. Sections in nromal type are told from the character's point of view. Italics denote out of game thoughts.

Our story begins in the Deep Wilds. Flint was a member of the Broken Glen community on the outskirts, but did something unspeakable and was banished. Around the same time, strange inhuman raiders began to attack the village. Many secretly believe the two events are related, and even Flint wrestles with doubt. Flint needs to track down the source of raiders, in the hopes of restoring her reputation and regaining her true name.

----

She dreamt of the hamlet before they came. On her shoulders was a pole, where three rabbits hung. She dodged the boy and he ran past her, and stepped aside to let her pursuers by. There were seven children now, and Broken Glen seemed like a name from the past. A name from the past._

She awoke with a start. There is a wolf at the edge of her camp, eyeing her. She can make out the shape of it in the light of the big moon.

_In Ironsworn, a player rolls a 6-sided Action die, applies any character bonuses that apply, and compares the result to two 10-sided Challenge dice. Throughout this play report, I detail what move and bonuses apply, and I show all the roles so you the reader can get a feel for the system._

_Here, we Enter the Fray. Challenge dice of 2 and 5, roll of 4 plus Heart of 2 yields a strong hit. Flint has initiative and +2 momentum._

Slowly and quietly, she notches an arrow. Still in her bedroll, she points the arrow at the wolf and sends it flying.

_Flint strikes. Challenge dice say 1 and 4. Her action die of 3, plus Edge of 3 — her 6 beats both for a strong hit. She maintains initiative. She gets to mark three ticks’ worth of progress — two for being a Extreme foe and and extra due to her strong hit. Why is this lone wolf an Extreme foe? Keep reading._

She hears it yelp in the dark, sees its shape twist by the trunk of the tree. She rolls into a kneel and has another arrow notched. The wolf steps toward her and growls. Even in the pale light of the moon, its teeth gleam.

_Flint strikes again. Not so lucky this time. Got a 6 on the action die, so 9 with her Edge. However, the challenge dice are 4 and 10, so this is a weak hit. The two progress she gets finishes the first of 10 boxes and puts a mark in the second, but the wolf gets initiative._

Another arrow flies true and hits the wolf. It snarls and leaps at her. To Flint’s dismay, her shots do not sink into its hide, so the wolf is merely angered by her bow! Worse yet, this is no ordinary wolf. It’s as large as a bear!

_Now it becomes clear, this is a dire wolf. The wolf closed the gap, so Flint is using her knife now. The move is Clash, since she doesn’t have the initiative. The roll is 5, plus her Iron of 2. That 7 result lies between the Challenge dice roll of 5 and 8, so it’s a weak hit._

Flint steps aside as the wolf leaps, avoiding its charge. The wolf did not put all of its bulk into the charge, though. While she drops the bow and pulls her knife, it regains its feet and bites down hard on her forearm. She yelps and slashes at it, drawing blood.

_A weak hit means that she gets to mark progress (1 1/2 boxes full), but still does not have the initiative. Worse, she has to Pay the Price, in this case, losing 2 Health via the Endure Harm move. She had +5, so now has +3 Health. It’s the wolf’s move._

The wolf twists its head and tries to wrestle Flint to the ground.

_This is another Clash role. The Challenge dice say 5 and 5 — more on that in a moment. However, her role is a 6, so the result is a 8 after adding her Iron. A strong hit, and she regains the initiative. The Progress track gets two more marks, and now has two boxes full and one slash in the third. She’s also take a +1 to her momentum, thank you very much._

Flint steps around, so she can get to the wolf’s throat. She uses the fact that wolf has a tight grip on her forearm and takes a stab in the dark. The wolf instantly lets go and scurries back, whimpering.

_She strikes. Ooh, the Challenge dice are double 1’s. Her action die of 3 is enough to best those by itself — a strong hit. Since she gets three marks, she is done with her third box on the progress meter!_

She sees rage in the wolf’s eye. It bounds forward and tries to bite her again, but it slips off her bloody forearm.

_I decided that the Challenge dice match of 5’s earlier gave the wolf some pause and gave her some protection against being bit. Let’s consult the Combat Action Oracle table for the 1’s. A roll of 77 says ‘Create an opportunity’ — for Flint, since it was a strong hit on her part. I’m going to hold this in reserve, when a fictional opportunity presents itself._

Flint presses her advantage.

_Flint rolls a 6 on the action die, for 8 total. The Challenge dice are 1 and 6, so yet another strong hit! That puts 3 of 4 marks into the fourth progress box. Let’s try to get at least that 4th box full before trying to end the fight._

She pins the wolf to the ground with her knee and she stabs it again. A look a fear begins to cross the wolf’s eyes.

_She strikes again. Challenge dice say 3 and 4, and she rolls a 5 on the action die. That strong hit will finish off the 4th progress box and get another two marks into the 5th. She tries to finish the fight. Oh, sad day! She rolls an 8 and 9 on the Challenge dice, which is a miss! She needs to Pay the Price and loses initiative._

She slips on the bloody wolf’s coat and her knee slides off its chest. It claws at her and pushes her away. As she feels the scratch on her cheek, the wolf rolls to its feet. It starts to bound away.

_Wolf pelts are valuable, dire wolf pelts triply so, and it’s leaving a trail of blood — a result of the opportunity created by the 1’s match earlier._

She grabs her bow and begins to track it.

_Flint uses the Gather Information move to follow the blood trail. Flint has the Ranger asset, so she gets to add +1 to the roll and take +1 momentum on a hit. She rolls a 5 on the action die, adds +1 for Wits, and the +1 from her asset. That 7 beats the two Challenge dice, 3 and 5, for a strong hit. She gets +3 momentum out of the deal, bringing her to +8! Better yet, she discovers something helpful and specific. I’m not sure what that is, so I’ll consult the Twists table for the Oracle — 37, “A more dangerous foe is revealed”. Since Flint got this information due to a strong hit and things are really going her way, I say this means she gets some forewarning._

As she traces the smears and drops of blood through the deer trails through the forest, she comes across some footprints. There are two sets, one is a pair of boots. The other is unlike anything she’s seen. They are long like a person’s foot, but shaped like a wolf’s. The air here smells wrong, a little sweet, and it sends a shiver up her spine.

_What to do? One thing I should do here is invoke the Reach a Milestone move. These footprints are a clue to her current vow, “Discover the source of the attack against her village.” It’s only a Dangerous quest, so she gets to mark 2 Progress. 2 down, 8 to go. Let’s Gather more Information._

Wary, she continues to follow the trail of blood. The patches of blood are getting smaller now, and farther between. It is as though some mystical power has healed its wounds!

_Flint rolls a 4. The +1 for her Wits and +1 for that Ranger asset gives a total 6. The challenge dice are a 4 and 6. Ties go to the Challenge dice, so it’s a weak hit. I am going to add a complication due to weather. Still, Flint gets to mark an extra momentum, and another due to her Ranger asset, so she’s at +10!_

The track go together into a denser part of the forest, where the fog is quite thick. It is always misting in the forest, it seems, but it has actually begun to rain in earnest. She things back to her camp and realizes her bedroll is getting wet. At this point, it can’t be helped. She has to see this through.

_Because of the rain, it’s going to be harder to track the wolf. Flint decides to Secure an Advantage. As with the Gather Information role before. She rolls a 6, +1 due to her Wits, and another +1 for her Ranger asset. Unfortunately, the Challenge dice are a 7 and 10, so that 8 she got yields just a weak hit. Note she gets would normally add a couple extra momentum here, but she’s already at her maximum of +10. I’m not sure how to weave this into the fiction, so let’s consult the Oracle again — 30, “Your actions benefit an enemy.” Hmm, I’m still not sure._

After a few minutes’ search, she finds a patch of fur stuck in the crook of a branch. It’s hard and wirery, not like a normal wolf pelt at all. In the fading light of the big moon, she sees a tinge of orange ahead, is that a fire?

“I may not have found the wolf,” she says to herself, “but I’ve found something more valuable.” She slinks away and dashes back to her camp.

As she feared, her bedroll is wet. She wrings it out best she can and rolls it up. She lowers her backpack from where it hung and coils up the rope. In just a few minutes, she’s ready to leave. She looks for a place deeper in the woods, where the trees and bushes may still hide a dry spot. She will need to light a fire to dry out her roll, or it will mold.

_Undertake a Journey is the most reasonable move to represent this. She rolls a 2. Her Wits of +1 only gives her a 3. The Challenge dice stare at her, a 9 and 10. She doesn’t want to Pay the Price for a miss, so she chooses to Burn Momentum instead. The two Challenge dice get canceled, which turns this would-be miss into a strong hit! It does mean her momentum is reset to +2, though._

She finds a group of bushes, almost like a cave. Under the thick branches, the dirt and leaves are dry. She cleans out a place to sleep, and uses the leaves as kindling to start her fire. She eats some dried meat and curls up in the leaves to sleep.

_The bushes are a waypoint. She chooses to make good use of her supplies, so her Supplies track stays at +5. She’s able to salvage her bedroll._

In the light before dawn, she checks her bedroll and finds it dry enough, thank the Spirits! She decides to make her way back to her old camp in order to pick up the trail once more. To her dismay, there are large wolf tracks, and more of the half-wolf man-prints in the mud.

_Flint will try to Secure an Advantage here. Her Wits is only +1, but she does get an additional +1 due to her Ranger path. Rolled a 4 on the Action die, so 6 total, and… whew, only a 3 and 4 on the Challenge dice. That’s a strong hit. Since I already have initiative, I will choose the +2 momentum, plus an additional +1 from the Ranger path. Flint is now up to +5._

These tracks are unlike anything she’s seen before, but the mud from last night preserved them well. Whatever made these tracks weighs a lot, as much as the blacksmith in the neighboring village. Tarsen is a huge man, all muscle. One thing that’s for sure, she cannot deal with this threat by herself.

“You know, Tarsen does owe me a favor. Maybe he can help me clear my name.”

_Okay, new objective, the village of Ashen Grove. Undertake a Journey time! This would be merely a troublesome journey, if it were not for the threat of the owner of those footprints and these raider attacks on her home in Broken Glen. Let’s call it a dangerous journey. Ashen Grove is two days’ walk from here. She recalls a meadow by a stream that is a good picnic spot for lunch. She sets off. Because of her Wayfinder asset, she will get +1 to this roll. Action die shows 5, +1 for her Wits, that’s 7 all told. Unfortunately, the Challenge dice are 2 and 9, so it’s only a weak hit._

She starts out slowly, watching her tracks, but after a quarter hour, she picks up pace and gets to the meadow around midday. She eats some of the bread and cheese she brought, and refills her waterskin. She still has enough food to make it all the way to Ashen Grove, so she presses on.

_The weak hit on the Undertake a Journey move cost her 1 Supply. She still has 4 Supply, so she’s going to keep going. Unfortunately, she only got a 2 on the Action die, so that’s a total of 4 on her Undertake a Journey roll. The Challenge dice say 8 and 9, which is a miss. Flint is as strong as she’s going to be. Let’s tempt fate and Pay the Price. The Oracle dice read… 56. “It takes extra time or puts you at a disadvantage: Suffer -momentum.” The default is -2, so Momentum is down to +3 now._

The bushes by the stream are thicker than she remembered, and it was already dusk by the time she reached the fire circle! It was about half a furlong from the road, and her firelight should be inconspicuous here. She hurried to assemble camp.

_This is Make Camp. Her Supply is +4, and her Action die is 3. However, the Challenge dice say 7 and 8, which is a miss. She must Pay the Price. The Oracle role of 41 says “the current situation worsens”. I think suffering a bad night’s sleep is punishment enough for Flint individually. However, there’s the village of Broken Glen to consider… More on that later._

There are strange noises in the forest tonight. She hears bushes rustling, and opens an eye each time the forest goes silent. Too soon the blackbirds start calling, and Flint reluctantly packs up camp. She is on the road before sun’s first light. She should be beyond the raider’s reach this far southwest, but she leaves the road where there is a hint of another traveler. She does not encounter anyone, but does not make great time. She looks for an out-of-the-way place to have lunch.

_Another Undertake a Journey role. It must be the fatigue! She only gets a 2 on the Action die, which with the +1 Wits and her Ranger path, makes for a 4. The Challenge dice are callous, reading 9 and 10. Another miss! The Oracle says… 7. “A person or community you care about is in danger.” Tell me something I don’t know. However, let’s make it obvious to Flint._

When she came to the road, she immediately notices something is amiss. There are large, recent ruts in the road. Many wagons have come through here, and there are hundred of shoe prints, hoof prints, and footprints leading away from Ashen Grove. She stoops down to examine the tracks in earnest.

_Let’s Gather Information. Her Wits is 1, and she rolls a 6! That 7 sits between the Challenge dice of 3 and 8, so it’s a weak hit. She does get +1 Momentum, bringing her up to +4. However, “the information complicates your quest or introduces a new danger.” There hasn’t been enough action on this quest lately, so let’s go with a new danger…._
