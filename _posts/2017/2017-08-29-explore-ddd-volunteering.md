Hello there!

The [Explore DDD](http://exploreddd.com) conference is only a few weeks away! Preparations are nearly done, but there is something we need your help with.

We are looking for a handful of volunteers to enhance the experience of our attendees and speakers throughout the event, by activities like introducing speakers, drumming up excitement with your colleagues, and answering logistics questions. We volunteers may take on other tasks, like facilitating a continuous retrospective and live tweeting the event. In short, we need ten or so people to be the eyes and ears of the conference, as well as to help the people on site get the most out of Explore DDD.

Candidates need to be available both days of the conference. Preference will be given to people who local and have an interest in domain-driven design, especially people who otherwise would not be able to attend. This is a great opportunity for students or professionals with financial constraints to participate in this first ever DDD conference in North America. Volunteers will receive complimentary admission and possibly other benefits.

I plan to assemble the volunteer team this week. Please email me at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#110;&#101;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#97;&#112;&#105;&#114;&#43;&#100;&#100;&#100;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#110;&#101;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#97;&#112;&#105;&#114;&#43;&#100;&#100;&#100;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> to apply for the role or to ask a question. I will be holding an informational meeting a week before the event to talk about the role and to answer questions.

I have volunteered for several conferences in the past, and I can say from personal experience that I get a lot more out of the conference as a volunteer than as a regular attendee. I ask you to consider volunteering with us. Thank you for your time and interest!

Regards,
Chuck Durfee
Volunteer Lead, Explore DDD
