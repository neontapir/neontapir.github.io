<p>Fresh off the episode about <a href="http://agilechuckwagon.com/dot-voting-1x03">Dot Voting (1x03)</a>, Chuck compares two popular meeting facilitation techniques in agile: lean coffee and open space. Lean Coffee is well suited for a small group of participants, who use a Kanban backlog and dot voting to work through a list of discussion topics. Open space has similar goals, but uses a marketplace of ideas and runs multiple conversations in parallel. Open space is a better fit for large groups.</p>
