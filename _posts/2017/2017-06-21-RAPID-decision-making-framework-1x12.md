## Agile Chuck Wagon, season 1, episode 12

In this episode, Chuck introduces listeners to the RAPID decision making framework. People take on the roles of Input, Recommend, Agree, Decide and Perform (in that order). He talks about why RAPID is a useful tool, and benefits it provides over other group decision tools like consensus. (length: 8 min)
