It's inconceivable that I didn't mention Peter Pan in this blog at all. I was the Stage Manager for the Gaslight Theater's production of _Peter Pan and Wendy_.

The show got [good reviews (YourHub)](http://denver.yourhub.com/Westminster/Stories/Goings-on/General/Story~496327.aspx) (MetroNorth News didn't have an online version of their full-page article), and the show sold out consistently towards the end. I'm proud of the notoriety we were able to bring to the theater.

The next show is Blithe Spirit, for which I'll be doing set construction. If you see it, I'd recommend calling for reservations.
