<p>My friends had a summer bash over the July 4th holiday, and introduced our family to <a href="http://www.backyardwashers.com/">Backyard Washers</a>. It is a low-budget game with some similarity to horseshoes, in that it's played outdoors and involves some skill throwing an object. Players compete in teams of two.</p>
<p>It requires two "washer boards", which are made from some plywood for the bottom, some 2x4 pieces for the sides, and a PVC pipe mounted in the middle. Two pairs of washers are also required -- 3" in diameter, I believe. They are painted to distinguish them. Oddly, their site doesn't appear to contain instructions for constructing your own set up.</p>
<p>The scoring makes the game. There are four scoring zones: inside the PVC ring in the center of the board (5 points), inside the board (3 points), on the lip (2 points), and within a beer or soda can of the board (1 point). The team whose washer lands in the highest scoring zone is the only team to earn points in a round. Washers in the same zone cancel, which adds some drama. If I land a washer in the box (3 points), the other team can cancel my score by placing a washer in the box themselves. Combined with the victory conditions (you must earn exactly 21 points to win; if you go over, the target score increases by 10, but only for your team), and each throw is eagerly watched by the opponents and bystanders alike.</p>
<p>It's well worth an afternoon to learn to play this game.</p>
