<p>It's inconceivable that I didn't mention Peter Pan in this blog at all. I was the Stage Manager for the Gaslight Theater's production of <em>Peter Pan and Wendy</em>.</p>
<p>The show got <a href="http://denver.yourhub.com/Westminster/Stories/Goings-on/General/Story~496327.aspx">good reviews (YourHub)</a> (MetroNorth News didn't have an online version of their full-page article), and the show sold out consistently towards the end. I'm proud of the notoriety we were able to bring to the theater.</p>
<p>The next show is Blithe Spirit, for which I'll be doing set construction. If you see it, I'd recommend calling for reservations.</p>
