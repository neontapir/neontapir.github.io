<p>The family and I went to see "It's A Wonderful Life: A Live Radio Play" at Gaslight Theater today.</p>
<p>I'm one of those rare people that hasn't seen the film, so my exposure to this story is solely through this production. Being a live radio play, the actors were playing actors performing the story live over the radio. </p>
<p>I enjoyed the voices the actors used to differentiate the characters. Randy Diamon as Clarence and Mr. Martini was particularly memorable. Josh Fisher gave a solid and moving performance as George Bailey. Fiona Turnbull (Violet) and Debbie Minter (Mary) were wonderful as well. Barry Allord's delivery (Mr. Potter) was oddly slow the first time I saw it, but he gave a better performance today.</p>
<p>Sound effects were provided live as well. Both performances I saw featured Val Durfee as the foley artist, who performed her job with style and aplomb. (Davita Terrell is also performing the role for some of the shows.)</p>
<p>The actors also have interesting interaction when they are not delivering lines, which gives the whole production a charming verisimilitude -- no doubt a credit to Jane Allard, the director. The on-air commercials for Bremel Shaving Cream and Dux Toilet Cake, the "sponsors" of the show, are not to be missed!</p>
<p>From friends who have seen both the movie and the play, "It's A Wonderful Life: A Live Radio Play" is a wonderful way to enjoy an old classic and support live theater. As an added bonus, there is an art cooperative who's running a holiday gift shop in the adjoining space, in case you are looking for a unique gift.</p>
