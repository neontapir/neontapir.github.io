### Agile Chuck Wagon, season 6, episode 10

I put off recording this episode this morning, so I decided to record an episode about procrastination and how I got past it.

In this episode, I refer to:

*   [Endorsement from Badass Agile](http://agilechuckwagon.com/endorsement-from-badass-agile)
*   [ACW: Mel Robbins's 5-second rule](http://agilechuckwagon.com/3x06-5-second-rule) (length: 9 min)
