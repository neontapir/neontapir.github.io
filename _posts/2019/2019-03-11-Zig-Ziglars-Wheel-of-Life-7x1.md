## Agile Chuck Wagon, season 7, episode 1

To start season 7, Chuck talks about a personal retrospective technique based on Zig Ziglar's seven spokes on his Wheel of Life. The idea is, people are balanced if they enjoy success in these seven areas: 

*   Mental
*   Spiritual
*   Physical
*   Family
*   Financial
*   Personal
*   Career
