Friends,

My employer, Graebel, is looking to bring JP Boodhoo's fantastic Nothin' But .NET course back to Denver this year! We plan to host the course at our headquarters in Aurora, Colorado sometime in mid-September. Many of the seats have already been reserved, but there are still a few available. Once we get enough participants, we can finalize the details.

The course costs $3000 per person. It is conducted over five 12-hour days -- Monday through Friday, 9am-9pm -- and combines top-notch .NET training with inspiration. The course is taught in a lecture-lab format and covers advanced uses of C# features like generics, delegates, and LINQ, as well as illustrating OO best practices and behavior-driven development.

The course evolves each time it's taught. When I took it last year, JP tasked us with building a fictitious front-controller e-commerce site from scratch. JP explained each concept in detail with examples, then we would pair in groups of 3 or 4 to design and complete features using what we had just learned, with JP providing expert guidance as needed. The best of breed would be used by the rest of the class going forward.

JP himself is well regarded in the industry, and he combines his blindingly fast programming and amazing craftsmanship with humor, humility and grace. He makes very difficult material seem easy and accessible to a wide range of audiences and learning styles. Nothin' But .NET is an excellent opportunity for senior and intermediate developers to take their game to the next level.

Here are some informative links about NBDN:

* Feedback from participants over the years: http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/SoWhatDoPastStudentsReallyThinkAboutNothinButNet.aspx  

I took this course last year at a time when my professional life was flagging and I was approaching burnout. NBDN strengthened my conviction that I am a solid programmer. Yet, it also taught me that after several years of .NET programming, there were still many wonders to explore within features I thought I knew or that I hadn't encountered before. Combined with the motivational material JP sprinkles throughout the course, I found myself boldly ready to climb new mountains with renewed zeal! If my story describes you too, you owe it to yourself to consider joining us!

Please contact me if you are interesting in signing up, or if you have any questions or want to learn more. I look forward to hearing from you!
