I've uploaded a presentation I made with [Haiku Deck](http://www.haikudeck.com/)
to SlideShare:

[slideshare id=14736147&doc=linq-121015114558-phpapp01]

Haiku Deck said I had us at frozen Han Solo and that it was a [virtuosic left
brain/right brain
combo](https://twitter.com/HaikuDeck/status/257899492601380864). Strong praise
indeed! I'm humbled.

Let me know what you think of it in the comments.
