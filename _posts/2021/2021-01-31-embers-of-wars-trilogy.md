![Embers of War Trilogy](/assets/embers-of-war-trilogy.jpg)

I recently reviewed **_Embers of War_ by Gareth Powell**.
A few weeks later, I've finished the trilogy.
Here are my thoughts.

It has been years since I read a sequel immediately after reading the first book in a series.
I normally alternate fiction and non-fiction.
In this case, I made an exception.
I'm glad I did.

In many ways, the writing and story improved as the novels progressed.
Each of the three books felt like an act in a larger story, which many other series fail to achieve.
The climax of the first novel informs the second, **_Fleet of Knives_**.
However, _Fleet_ raises the stakes from _Embers_.
The same is true of the third book, **_Light of Impossible Stars_**.
Also, the new characters in _Fleet_ and _Light_ did not irritate me as Ashton Childe did in
_Embers_.
The new characters in both books ended up having character arcs of their own,
whereas I felt like Childe existed merely as a catalyst to bring a change in others.
In _Fleet_ and _Light_, we see how all these characters are changed by their circumstances and choices.

There another pitfall that Powell avoids, that's common to movies as well.
It's easy to find examples of books and movies where the middle installments do not stand alone,
but instead only act as a long prologue to the next part.
A recent example is Jim Butcher's _Peace Talks_, which is a long prologue for the following novel _Battle Ground_.
Another glaring example is _The Deathly Hallows_ by J.K. Rowling,
in which a person can skip the first movie or first half of the book.
The story seemed to me only existed to emphasize how bad things were for Harry, Hermione, and Ron.
When events start picking up at the beginning of the next part, that's when the story regains interest.

I'm happy to report that _Fleet of Knives_ stands on its own, and so does _Light of Impossible Stars_.
At the end of _Embers_, there's an event that changes the lives of all the characters in the story.
_Fleet_ explores the consequences of that event, and our heroes old and new come face to face with a new challenge.
The new challenge is inherently interesting, and was worth a novel to explore.
In dealing with that challenge on a local, personal level, they realize more is at stake than they realized, and those stakes drive _Light_.
In structuring the plot this way, each installment is enjoyable as a discreet story.
At the end of each story, people are changed profoundly,
yet the tapestry of their intersecting lives form a coherent story.

It's akin to the original _Star Wars_ trilogy.
At the end of the _A New Hope_, it appears that all is well with the world.
So it is at the end of _Embers_.
However, _The Empire Strikes Back_ shows that the climax of _A New Hope_ was just a setback for the Empire.
Like _Empire_, _Fleet_ shows that there's more to the story than we first suspected in _Embers_.
And, like _Return of the Jedi_, _Light of Impossible Stars_ features a reckoning.

It's not a Rebellion versus Empire story, though there are political factions in _Embers of War_.
One of the elements I most enjoyed about the _Embers of War_ trilogy is the House of Reclamation.
The House is a place for people looking for a fresh start,
and its mission is to rescue ships and people in distress.
Our protagonists are trying to redeem the sins of their pasts, to greater and lesser degrees of success.
This theme of redemption plays strongly throughout the novels,
and that is what drew my comparison to the _Star Wars_ trilogy.

Reading the _Embers of War_ novels back to back, I did find some of the remembrances of past events distracting.
An author has to make sure that a reader who picks up the second book in a series isn't lost,
and Gareth Powell does that here.
However, for those of us who read about those events yesterday, we don't need reminding.

In many cases, though, the callbacks to previous events seemed natural.
Characters reflect on prior events as they experience loss and grief,
in some cases remembering lost comrades to each other.
The net effect is that the main characters had some depth and verisimilitude.

The later books also explore some of the milieu and trappings introduced in the first books.
In particular, the vessels in this series are intelligent and characters in their own right.
The ship _Trouble Dog_ becomes a well-rounded character in her own right.
I've seen multiple authors introduce elements like sentient ships,
but fail to illustrate the consequences of there being sentient ships.
Powell embraces this aspect of world-building, to my delight.

I recommend the series, and I'm excited that it's coming to television.
