For six years running, I've had a reading goal of completing 52 books by the end of the year.
One thing I've learned is that if I'm not making time to read a book, it's not the right timing for me.
Such was the case for **_Embers of War_ by Gareth Powell**.

I started the book in early December.
It's a sci-fi epic, containing strong military elements.
I'm a fan of books like _Old Man's War_ by John Scalzi and _Starship Troopers_ by Robert Heinlein, so _Embers_ drew me in.

It was an interesting plot, and the book was unusual in that the story is told in the first person.
Each chapter is told from the point of view of a main or secondary character.
I found that the device caused me to become more intimate and invested in the characters.
And yet, due to holiday activities and the process of moving, I found myself not coming back to the book.
I set it aside for a graphic novel.

A couple weeks later, I was looking for something new to read.
I remembered enjoying _Embers_, so I picked it back up again.
I'm glad I did!

I feel that the book picks up at about the third-way point.
Sal Konstanz, her ship the _Trouble Dog_, and Ona Sudak became real for me, and I wanted to know what happened to them.
I also found the concept of the House of Reclamation interesting, a place for troubled people to find a new lease on
life.
I've wanted that too, at times.

Powell uses the sci-fi elements of the book to his advantage.
The set pieces are intriguing and well-described.
While technology plays a key role in the book, in the end, this is a human story about people -- just the way I like it.

In looking back at the book, I realized that I was less interested in the Ashton Childe subplot, which was the focus of
the part of the book where I put it down.
I think I was initially looking for a romp like _The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet_ by Becky Chambers, but this book takes
itself more seriously than that.
By the end of the book, I came to appreciate Ashton and understand why he's there, but he's still not my favorite
character.

I recommend _Embers of War_, and I'm looking forward to reading the other books in the series.
