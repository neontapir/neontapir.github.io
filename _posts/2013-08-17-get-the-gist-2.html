<p>Recently, I discovered Gists, a code snippet publishing platform by GitHub. In fact, a Gist is essentially a one-file GitHub repository.</p>
<p>I published <a href="https://gist.github.com/neontapir">two Gists</a> recently. The first is a C# code sample of an ASP.NET Web API service that uses <code>AttributeRouting</code>. I found some examples of each piece, but not in combination. It took some time to get it working, so I thought it was worth sharing.</p>
<p>The other is a build script for the <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> editor, which renders an <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a> document in HTML on a Windows system. It was inspired by <a href="https://gist.github.com/karmi/3804588">this user's gist</a> for a Unix system.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a quick way to share a code snippet, Gists are a good choice. Likewise, if you are looking for something similar to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> that's more fully featured, Asciidoc may be the thing for you. Not only can you generate HTML, but it can be used to produce LateX, PDF and DocBook documents amongst others.</p>
