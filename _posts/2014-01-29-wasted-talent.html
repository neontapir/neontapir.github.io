<p>It’s easy to find examples of wasted talent, which comes from not making<br />
full use of a person’s talent, skill or knowledge.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen this in firms where work assignments are not fungible.<br />
For example, imagine a shop where most of the software is written in<br />
Java, but some is written in Ruby from an acquisition. Let’s say there<br />
are 15 Java programmers and 5 Ruby programmers, and neither group is<br />
particularly familiar with the other language.</p>
<p>One day, the company publishes its quarterly roadmap. On it, there is a<br />
single feature for a Ruby product and ten features for Java products.<br />
The Ruby developers are left with a choice of learning Java or lying<br />
fallow. Either choice leads to individuals not utilizing their Ruby<br />
skills, which is a waste.</p>
<p>One technique that can help with wasted talent is <strong>paired<br />
programming</strong>. The effect of pairing is skills or knowledge transfer, so<br />
use of paired programming can help the Ruby programmer learn Java and<br />
those Java products more quickly. While pairing is often slower than<br />
solo programming, it does leads to fewer defects and allows both<br />
programmers' talents to be used — albeit at a lesser capacity at first.</p>
<p>I saw this waste occur when a firm hired a quality engineer who is<br />
skilled at test automation, but was instead tasked with manual execution<br />
of test cases. In particular, the regression suite of the legacy product<br />
took days to walk through, and the test teams received code too late to<br />
have adequate time to execute the full suite.</p>
<p>Test automation is an investment in the product, and it’s not free. Even<br />
for a greenfield application, it will often take more time to write an<br />
automated test than to execute it manually. Of course, once the test is<br />
automated, it can be executed in a fraction of the time, which pays<br />
dividends.</p>
<p>Pairing in this case was challenging because many of the manual testers<br />
did not know how to program. And automation of the regression test<br />
scripts right before a release is not an ideal classroom setting. A<br />
coding dojo would be a better environment to convey the power of test<br />
automation.</p>
<p><strong>Coding dojos</strong> are collaborative learning environments where people<br />
can acquire new skills. For example, there is an exercise ("kata")<br />
called the Bowling Game that’s used to teach test-first development<br />
(TDD). Participants in the kata, even ones who haven’t programmed<br />
before, learn the exercise by rote to start with. Questions leads to<br />
learning programming concepts as students are ready. There are different<br />
katas and sample applications available on the internet that would make<br />
a suitable subject for test automation.</p>
<p>Sadly in this case, the firm did not want to make that investment.<br />
Predictably, the test automation engineer found a position elsewhere<br />
because he found the work unsatisfying.</p>
<p>Next time, we'll look at wasted inventory.</p>
