<p>After much waiting, our family got a Wii for Christmas. Rather than spend a lot on games the kids won't play, we decided to follow a similar model to the way we consume DVDs. We got a subscription to GameFly, and will only buy the games the kids really want.</p>
<p>Our Wii was bundled with Wii Sports. We spent most of the day taking turns playing the Wii. It was a lot of fun! the games were easy to learn and intuitive, though we certainly did not approach the skill of the kids, who took turns more often than we did.</p>
<p>Frankly I had a little trouble with Boxing and Tennis, but greatly enjoyed Golf and Baseball. I wish games like Boxing and Baseball had the depth Golf does. It's no EA Sports simulation, but it's got enough content to satisfy casual fans.</p>
<p>I'm chomping at the bit to try some football, basketball, and baseball games.</p>
<p>Edit: Watching my friends play reminded me of another criticism they leveled yesterday. The Mii people don't have any arms! It was a little disturbing to them to see these Mii people doing stuff with bobbing hands, mitts, what have you.</p>
