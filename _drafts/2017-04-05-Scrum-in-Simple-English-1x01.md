### Agile Chuck Wagon, season 1, episode 1

In this inaugural episode (1x01), Chuck gives an overview of Scrum in 5 minutes using Simple English.The idea for this episode came from a statement by Lyssa Adkins of [_Coaching Agile Teams_](http://www.coachingagileteams.com/) fame. He talks about Charles Ogden and Basic English ([ogden.basic-english.org](/agilechuckwagon/episode/update/id/ogden.basic-english.org)), and how it grew into Simple English. After giving a description of Scrum, Chuck talks about why this exercise is worthwhile. (length: 10 min)
