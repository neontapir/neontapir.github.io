### Agile Chuck Wagon, season 3, episode 5

In this episode of the Agile Chuck Wagon, Chuck talks about a game called Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. It is a collaborative game, using a computer program and PDF printout to simulate the activity of defusing a bomb through solving logic puzzles. Thus, it makes for a fun virtual teambuilding exercise.   
  
You can find out more about this game at its homepage, [www.keeptalkinggame.com](http://www.keeptalkinggame.com).
