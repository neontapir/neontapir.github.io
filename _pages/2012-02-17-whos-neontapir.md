Hello, my name is Chuck Durfee, and welcome to my site!

I manage software delivery teams, usually geographically distributed. I bring a strong test-driven and domain-driven design ethic to my work. I do my work in multiple languages like Ruby, JavaScript, C#, PowerShell, Neo4J and SQL, because I've found different languages suit different problems. I excel at creating technical communities of practice: leading book clubs, code katas, brown bag lunch sessions and mentoring junior programmers. My résumé is available upon request.

I thrive in an agile delivery environment. I am a Certified Scrum Master and have catalyzed the adoption and dispersion of Scrum and Lean practices including Kanban at a number of companies. I'm active in the Agile Denver user group, was a board member for a two-year term, and have helped organize their Mile High Agile conference for the past five years. I've spoken at the last three Mile High Agile conferences on technical topics of interest to agile practitioners.

Over the course of my life, I have studied several languages: German, Mandarin Chinese, French, Spanish, Esperanto, to name a few. Maybe it’s my mathematics bent, but I’m continually fascinated by the whole idea that I can smack some blocks with my fingers, the hammering form glyphs, and you, who might be half a world away, can discover something about what I’m thinking. Or, that I can whisper and be heard a thousand miles away. Language is so powerful, and technology just magnifies its effect a thousandfold. A googlefold.

I hold a second degree black belt (II Dan) with the United States Taekwon-Do Federation. I started taekwon-do as an adult, though I don't train actively these days. I'm looking for a physical activity that's more gentle on my body. I do enjoy hiking, geocaching and playing backyard sports with the kids.

I play many board and card games. Among my favorites are Power Grid, 7 Wonders, Caverna, Dominion, Settlers of Catan, Forbidden Island, Small World and Pandemic. I got into board gaming by becoming a demo rabbit for Looney Labs games at local conventions.

I enjoy tabletop roleplaying games, too. I have been a gamemaster for over 30 years. Google+ Hangouts have revitalized my interest in the hobby. These days, I prefer story games like Dungeon World, Monsterhearts and FATE though I've played my fair share of crunchier systems including Doctor Who RPG, Star Trek RPG and yes, Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

The nickname "neon tapir" came from a meme game on LiveJournal a long time ago when I was tiring of my previous nickname. While I adore tapirs and think the nickname evokes a bit of a cyberpunk feel, I wonder if the moniker would represent me. "Neontapir" endures, it's catchy and starts conversations.
